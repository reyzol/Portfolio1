        <h1>What Is a Full-Stack Developer?</h1><br>
         <p>Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack developers straddle two separate web development domains: the front end and the back end.
            The front end includes everything that a client, or site viewer, can see and interact with. By contrast, the back end refers to all the servers, databases, and other internal architecture that drives the application; usually, the end-user never interacts with this realm directly. 
            Full-stack developers may be creative, graphically inclined, internet- and tech-savvy, and have excellent attention to detail. Youâ€™ll want to learn the following skills to have a career in full-stack development:

            Front-end development is the process of creating the interface of a website. It entails coding details like drop-down menus, fonts, colors, and page layouts. Full-stack developers should also know how to work with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and scripting languages such as JavaScript to make websites and applications visually viable and appealing. If you want to transition into full-stack development from back-end development, you might consider earning a Professional Certificate in front-end development from an industry leader like Meta.</p>
