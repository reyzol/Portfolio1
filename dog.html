                        <p>Dalmatian, a breed of dog distinguished by <br> its black or gray coat, and closely resembling <br> the modern Dalmatian. 
                        This <br> breed was known in the ancient world. <br> For example, the pictures found <br> as a result of excavations <br> in Greece 
                        allowed to notice <br>similar animals next to humans, <br> which are very similar to modern <br>Dalmatian dogs. And that 
                        means that the <br> Dalmatians have existed <br> for several millennia. Dalmatians <br>are active dogs and require <br> long walks 
                        in the fresh air.</p>
